This is an [AIML 2.0](http://www.aiml.foundation/) bot and associated [SRGS](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/) files for a chat bot that acts as an Expert in the game [*Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*](https://keeptalkinggame.com/). For more information, follow the links above. It is designed to be used with my [AIML Voice](https://github.com/AndrioCelos/AIML/tree/master/AimlVoice/) interpreter.

The bot recognises specific protocols for the Defuser to use to tell it what is on the bomb. For more information, see the doc directory.

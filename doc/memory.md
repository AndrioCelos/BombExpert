# On the Subject of Memory

Say `defuse memory` to select a Memory module. Say `resume memory` to resume work on a Memory module that was interrupted.

At each stage, list the number on the display followed by the numbers on the buttons from left to right. The bot will reply with the label you must press.

Say `new set` to start working on a new module.

# On the Subject of Memory

Say `defuse memory` to select a Memory module. Say `resume memory` to resume work on a Memory module that was interrupted.

At each stage, read the number on the display. If the bot tells you to press a certain *position*, tell what *label* was in that position, and vice versa.

Say `new set` to start working on a new module.

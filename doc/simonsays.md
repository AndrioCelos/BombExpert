# On the Subject of Simon Says

Say `defuse Simon Says` to select a Simon Says module.

Firstly, the bot will ask whether the serial number contains a vowel, if this is not already known. Answer with `yes` or `no`.

Then list the colours that flash, in order. The bot will reply with the colours you must press.

Be sure to update the number of strikes when needed by saying `strike zero`, `strike one` or `strike two`.

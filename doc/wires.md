# On the Subject of Wires

Say `defuse wires` to select a Wires module.

Firsy, the bot will ask you for the colours of the wires, List them from top to bottom. The bot will then ask any necessary [edgework](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/FAQs.html#edgework) questions; answer these with `yes`, `no` or a number. She will then state which wire to cut.

If there are multiple Wires modules, you can then list the wires on the next one.

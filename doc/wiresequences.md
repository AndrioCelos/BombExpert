# On the Subject of Wire Sequences

Say `defuse wire sequences` to select a Wire Sequences module.

For each panel, describe the wires in order of the numbered sockets by stating the colour and which letter it connects to. Say `next` between wires. The NATO phonetic alphabet is preferred: that is, `alfa`, `bravo` or `charlie`.  The bot will tell you which wires, if any, you must cut.

In the event that you encounter a panel with no wires at all, simply move to the next panel without giving any commands.

Say `new sequence` to start working on a new module.

>**Defuser**: Defuse wire sequences\
>**Bot**: For each wire in order from 1 to 3, say what colour it is and what letter it connects to.\
>**Defuser**: Black alfa, next, blue alfa, next, black charlie\
>**Bot**: Cut both black wires.\
>**Defuser**: Red charlie\
>**Bot**: Cut the wire.\
>**Defuser**: Blue bravo, next, black charlie\
>**Bot**: Do not cut those wires.\
>**Defuser**: Black alfa, next, black charlie, next, red bravo\
>**Bot**: Cut the red wire. Cut the first black wire.

# On the Subject of the Button

Say `defuse button` to select a Button module.

Firsy, the bot will ask you for the colour and label of the button. She will then ask any necessary [edgework](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/FAQs.html#edgework) questions; answer these with `yes`, `no` or a number. She will then state what to do with the button.

If you must hold down the button, tell her the colour light that appears. She will state when to release the button.

If there are multiple Button modules, you can then describe the next one.

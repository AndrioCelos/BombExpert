# On the Subject of Who's On First

Say `defuse Who's on First` to select a Who's on First module.

Start by reading the text in the display. If your input is recognised, the bot will tell you which button label to read. After you read the button label, the bot will reply with a list of button labels. You must press the first label in the list that is on the module.

Say `next set` to start the next stage or a new module. As a short cut, you may read the new display immediately after this command in the same message.

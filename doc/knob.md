# On the Subject of Knobs

Say `defuse knob` to select a Knob module.

List the states of the six lights on the left side of the module, as `on` or `off`. `All off` is also recognised. The bot will tell you which direction to turn the knob to. This is with respect to the 'Up' label; for instance, if the bot says 'up', you must turn the knob to wherever the 'Up' label actually is.
